#Installation Instructions

1. Clone the repo locally on your machine
2. Two folders will appear: 1. chat-web-application chat-web-api
3. Cd into the chat-web-api folder and run rails server
4. Cd into the chat-web-application
5. You can opt to connect to the API by making a change to the constant USE_API in src/config.ts. The default is set to true!
6. Run npm start


#Technologies Used

Front End - React, TypeScript, Jest for testing

Back End - Rails


#Requirements for Full Stack

Candidates must meet BOTH of the criteria for Front-end and Back-end sections,
therefore I have chosen two features from the two sections



Front End:

1. I can see a list of all the channels 
2. I can joins channel and see the history of it

Back End:

1. As a consumer of API, I can persist my chat messages in specific channels I join.
2. As a consumer of the API, I can see a list of all the available channels


#Why these features?

I choose these features because they were inherent with one another which allowed me to connect my work between the two stacks. 

Working with rails for the first time had me in deep water just for a little bit, I found my footing quickly and I'm excited to write more code in rails!

#Next steps & assumpions

Given I had more time I would have definitely liked to see all the features implemented. 

Assumptions made: I made the assumption that applying for the full-stack developer role that it would have made sense to connect my front-end to my api.
